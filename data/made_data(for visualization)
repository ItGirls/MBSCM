 * I treated 'nan' as '1' for the last one, like the matlab code and the paper did.
 * You should consider the order as well. So what this indicated is that 1 to 12 in tuple, element[0] is x-axis,
 and element[1] in tuple in the conductances value.
 So in fact conductance value for index 2 is 1., and 3 is 1., 5 is 1.34, 4 is 1.34 and it goes on like this, you can check the figure in the paper.
 I attached the figure see the  Ïƒ =(4,5,1,3,2,7,6,9,8,10)
